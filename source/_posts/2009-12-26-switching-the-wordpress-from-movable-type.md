My Japanese blog (kwlog) have be published Movable Type for three years. I decided to switch to the WordPress because I could not use the Movable Type 5 intuitively. 

I haved moved 1500 entries to WordPress. Now, I am writhing the plugin insted of Movable Type plugin (ex. textfilter)... I am sorry that I leave to develop a Movable Type plugin maybe, and I'll become a wordpress plugin developer. :)
