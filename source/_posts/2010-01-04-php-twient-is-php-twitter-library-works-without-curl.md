I did not want to develop twitter library. But, I have to work wituout php_curl.

## php-twient is:

 * PHP5 Object Oriented
 * Supports basicAuth and OAuth both
 * Supports autoload
 *  Should work with/without php_curl (auto detect php_url)

## future

 * Supports more twitter API (v0.1 is statuses API only)
 * Fix that OAuth part use php 5.3 Deprecated function
