The guidgen that is tools to generate GUID. I often used it to develop COM.

In the Visual Studio 6.0, the Visual Studio included the guidgen. However, the VS.NET dosen't include it but Windows SDK includes it. Therefore I forget and lose it sometimes.

Then I developed the guidgen web application and released it here: <a href="http://labs.makotokw.com/guidgen/" title="guidgen">http://labs.makotokw.com/guiden/</a> "guid web application" use ExtJS and BlzGuid.js. 

Please use it! And let me know if you found any problems!
